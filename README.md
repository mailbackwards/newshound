# Newshound

A sample app that demonstrates some simple, sustainable Django admin features
and packages around custom views and actions.

Contains articles, as well as a database of dog breeds and their breed types.
The breeds/groups data is real! The dogs are not.

Created for [DjangoCon 2017](https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/saved-you-a-click-or-three-supercharging-the-django-admin-with-actions-and-views/).

For dogs, by dogs, about dogs.
